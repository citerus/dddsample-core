Architecture

  The sample application is layered as illustrated by this picture:

[images/layers.jpg]

  There are three vertical layers: Interfaces, Application and Domain, each supported by different kinds of infrastructure.

{Interfaces}

	This layer holds everything that interacts with other systems, such as web services, RMI interfaces
	or web applications, and batch processing frontends. It handles interpretation, validation and translation
	of incoming data. It also handles serialization of outgoing data, such as HTML or XML across HTTP to
	web browsers or web service clients, or DTO classes and distributed facade interfaces for remote Java clients.

{Application}

    The application layer is responsible for driving the workflow of the application, matching the use cases at hand.
    These operatios are interface-independent and can be both synchronous or message-driven.
    This layer is well suited for spanning transactions, high-level logging and security.

    The application layer is thin in terms of domain logic - it merely coordinates the domain
    layer objects to perform the actual work.

{Domain}

	The domain layer is the heart of the software, and this is where the interesting stuff happens.
	There is one package per aggregate, and to each aggregate belongs entities, value objects, domain events,
	a repository interface and sometimes factories. The aggregate roots are
	<<<{{{xref/se/citerus/dddsample/domain/model/cargo/Cargo.html}Cargo}}>>>,
	<<<{{{xref/se/citerus/dddsample/domain/model/handling/HandlingEvent.html}HandlingEvent}}>>>, 
	<<<{{{xref/se/citerus/dddsample/domain/model/location/Location.html}Location}}>>> and
	<<<{{{xref/se/citerus/dddsample/domain/model/voyage/Voyage.html}Voyage}}>>>.

	The core of the business logic, such as determining whether a handling event should be registered and how the delivery of a cargo
	is affected by handling, belongs in here. The structure and naming of aggregates, classes and methods in
	the domain layer should follow the ubiquitous language, and you should be able to explain to a domain expert
	how this part of the software works by drawing a few simple diagrams and using the actual class and method names
	of the source code.

{Infrastructure}

	In addition to the three vertical layers, there is also the infrastructure. As the the picture shows, it supports
	all of the three layers in different ways, facilitating communication between the layers. In simple terms,
	the infrastructure consists of everything that exists independently of our application: external libraries,
	database engine, application server, messaging backend and so on.

	Also, we consider code and configuration files  that glues the other layers to the infrastructure as part of the infrastructure layer.
	Looking for example at the persistence aspect, the database schema definition, Hibernate configuration and mapping files
	and implementations of the repository interfaces are part of the infrastructure layer.

	While it can be tricky to give a solid definition of what kind of code belongs to the infrastructure layer for any given situation,
	it should be possible to completely stub out the infrastructure in pure Java unit/scenario tests and still be able to
	use the domain layer and possibly the application layer to work out the core business problems.

{Interactions}

    The interactions between the layers is shown here.

    - The Application which drives the workflow is in light green.

    - The Domain which encapsulate the business logic is in light pink.

    - The Infrastructure which supports the other layers is in light blue.

    We chose not to show the Interfaces which handle the communication with other systems.
    
    We chose to only show the persistence part of the Infrastructure.
